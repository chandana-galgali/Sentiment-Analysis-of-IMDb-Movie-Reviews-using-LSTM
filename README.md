# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDb-Movie-Reviews-using-LSTM
The project's goal is to build, train, and evaluate a Deep Learning model capable of performing sentiment analysis. It uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, built with TensorFlow and Keras, to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as either "Positive" or "Negative".
